# HANDOVER — Cairn

**Session date:** 2026-07-03 · **Spec/ADRs:** v0.41 · **Phase:** architecture complete; **first production clinical
surface under construction** — demographics on `cairn-node` (slices 1–5 done) + the §5.2 matcher (piece A in-DB veto
floor · B1 advisory scoring core · B2 veto-gated pairwise pipeline + proposal worklist · B2b blocking / candidate-pair
generation + batch sweep · B3 eval harness · B3 compound blocking key · B3 synthetic volume generator · **the matcher
now consumes `patient_alias_pool` (known-alias evidence) — done this session**) + the
**§5.7 identity core: C1 linkage · C2 human-accepted apply seam · C2b auto-apply of the `auto_candidate` band · C3
`dispute` + the chart trust-state projection · C4 `identify` + the *unconfirmed* trust state · C5 `repudiate` + the
known-alias pool** (the §5.7 confirmed/unconfirmed/under-review contract is COMPLETE, and C5 added
the first *suppressing* identity event) + the **§5.4 John-Doe registration front door — slice A: callsign minting +
matcher placeholder exclusion — done this session**; remaining B3 weight-learning / locale packs / A-B pass-toggle +
identity **C5+** (`reattribute` — waits on a clinical-note surface —) + the **rest of the §5.4 subsystem** (clinician-
observed evidence assertions, the "prior history now available" push-alert, the search-before-create registration-class
funnel) next. Viability proven by spikes (walking skeleton, advisory-actor contract, a first federating node,
Postgres-on-Android).

**This session (2026-07-03) — §5.4 John-Doe registration, slice A: callsign minting + matcher placeholder exclusion**
(brainstorm→spec→plan→inline-TDD; spec+plan under `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-07-03-john-doe-callsign-registration*`).
The §5.4 **registration front door** C4 explicitly deferred: what a clinician invokes when an unconscious/unknown patient
arrives. C4 (db/024) had already built the *unconfirmed* trust state + `identity.pending.asserted`; this slice supplies
the **UUID + system-generated callsign** and the matcher exclusion that makes the callsign safe, **composing built
primitives — NO new event types, NO `db/` migration, NO floor change, NO SCHEMA/ADR/spec bump.** Three parts:
(1) **pure callsign generator** in `cairn-event` (`john_doe::callsign` → `Unknown-<class>-<site>-<date>-<suffix>`; a
culture-neutral, deterministic, obviously-not-a-real-name string; `sanitize_part` is **Unicode-aware** — a non-Latin
site label is preserved, not dropped, per the anti-cultural-capture mission); (2) **`register_john_doe`** in `cairn-node`
(`john_doe.rs` + a `register-john-doe` CLI subcommand) — mints a UUID, then authors a **callsign name assertion**
(`demographic.field.asserted`, `facets.use="callsign"`, reusing `name_assertion_body`/`render_name_twin`) **and** the C4
`identity.pending.asserted` in **one transaction**, so the chart is never half-registered and renders *unconfirmed*;
(3) **matcher placeholder exclusion** (advisory, `matcher/pipeline/db.py`) — both the blocking `name_tokens` CTE and the
`load_candidate` scoring query exclude `use_key ∈ {callsign}` (`use_key <> ALL(%s)`), so two John Does registered at the
same site on the same day **never false-match on shared callsign tokens** ("unknown", the site, the date). **The
load-bearing calls:** the callsign is a **real, displayed name** in `patient_name` (db/012's unidentified-patient
fallback makes it the header winner) — §5.4's "exclude from feature space" is therefore a **query-time exclusion in the
advisory matcher**, the correct layer (§5.2/§5.13, principle 12), never a floor rule or a decision to withhold the name;
the suffix is **UUID-derived** (last 4 hex), **partition-safe with zero coordination** (a readable per-site-per-day A/B/C
counter would race under partition — §5.4 is local-by-construction), and a duplicate callsign string is cosmetic (the
UUID is identity, the callsign is excluded from matching); registration-class = C4's pending marker (no new "unidentified"
flag). The advisory exclusion is enough because it removes the pair from **blocking**, so a callsign pair is never even
generated, never scored, never auto-banded (defense-in-depth for the C2b auto-link path). TDD: 8 pure callsign tests
(`cairn-event`) + 4 pure builder + 3 DB-gated integration tests (`cairn-node/tests/john_doe.rs`: unconfirmed chart ·
callsign is a placeholder-use display-winner · two John Does coexist distinct) + 4 DB-gated matcher tests
(`test_john_doe_exclusion.py`: two callsigns → no pair · callsign excluded from scoring · a real name on the SAME chart
still blocks/scores · a real token vs a callsign token does not pair); `conftest.seed_patient` gained a `callsign_names`
param. Full `cargo test --workspace` **379 passed / 0 failed** + workspace clippy clean; matcher **207 passed** (DB) /
164 passed (pure); ruff clean — all on a **PG16 + cairn_pgx 0.2.0** rig stood up from scratch in-container this session
(pgrx 0.18.1, `--features pg16`, `postgresql-server-dev-16` headers, local-TCP `trust`). **End-to-end CLI smoke:**
`register-john-doe` on a provisioned node minted `Unknown-ed-bay3-2026-07-03-dc88`, chart *unconfirmed*, callsign stored
`use_key='callsign'`; a second run produced a distinct callsign and reused the actor (idempotent `device`-actor enroll).
**Review hardening** (2-agent adversarial pass — correctness agent found **0 bugs**): (a) extracted the triplicated
`next_hlc` HLC-tick helper into a shared `db::next_hlc` (`auto_apply` + `john_doe` now both call it — house-rule #4);
(b) dropped a dead `.to_ascii_uppercase()` in `suffix_from_uuid` (the sanitizer lower-cases it anyway — doc/output now
agree); (c) made `sanitize_part` Unicode-aware (was ASCII-only, folding non-Latin labels to "unknown" — a cultural-
capture smell; now preserves any script). **Deferred (recorded):** the **clinician-observed evidence assertions**
(estimated age with basis → dob, observed sex → sex reuse existing fields; photo/marks/belongings/EMS context need a new
field home — larger, separate slice); the **"prior history now available — N allergies, M meds" push-alert** on link
(§5.12, no notification tier yet); the **search-before-create registration-class funnel** (§5.3/§5.8, UI/API tier); a
**readable sequential callsign suffix** (`-A`/`-B`; needs a partition-safe per-day count); wiring `identify`→optional-link
into one resolution flow; a **cross-language guard** for the `CALLSIGN_USE`↔`PLACEHOLDER_NAME_USES` constant (documented
both sides, safe failure mode = reduced recall never a false merge, so noted not built). **§5.4 John-Doe slice A (callsign
+ matcher exclusion) is now BUILT.**

**Prior session (2026-07-03) — the §5.2 matcher consumes `patient_alias_pool` (known-alias evidence)**
(brainstorm→spec→plan→inline-TDD; spec+plan under
`docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-07-03-matcher-consume-alias-pool*`). Closes C5's deferred matcher wiring — the
`patient_alias_pool` VIEW C5 built was inert. **Advisory Python only (`matcher/…/pipeline/{alias,db,runner,banding}.py`);
NO `db/` floor, NO SCHEMA/ADR/spec bump.** **The load-bearing finding:** because C5 left db/012's `patient_name`
retained set physically untouched, a struck name is **still a blocking token *and* still scored**, so the
returning-fabricated-persona pair (chart A's struck alias vs a new chart B registered under it) **already** gets
proposed — consuming the alias pool does **not** enable a missing match. Its genuine value is **explainability /
paper-parity**: the proposal now carries a `known_alias` evidence entry restoring the registry's "known alias" flag to
the worklist. **The deliberate clinical call — FLAG, never suppress:** the matcher **cannot** distinguish a returning
fabricated persona from a real, different bearer of that false name (from the name alone they are identical), so
suppression (scope option "stop matching the false name") would kill the very §5.5(a) recognition it exists to serve;
only a Human can adjudicate (§5.7). Mechanism: new pure **`known_alias_evidence`** (`pipeline/alias.py`) recognises a
repudiated alias corroborated by the *other* chart in **normalized space** (NFC + casefold token-bag, **reusing the
adapter's `_name_bag`** so "same name" is byte-identical to the scorer — no second, drifting definition; match is
normalized-exact, not fuzzy — fuzzy is deferred); **`band()` gains `has_known_alias` → always REVIEW** (never dropped
below threshold, never auto-linked on a name a chart declared false — the §5.7 "Human" reservation, mirroring the
existing shared-identifier veto-rescue; can only ever *surface*, never auto-reject); `build_payload` appends the
entries; `runner.propose` reads the **reason-free** `patient_alias_pool` (ADR-0006 confidentiality split preserved —
value only, never the forensic `reason`) for both charts and threads it through. TDD: 6 pure alias tests + 4 banding
tests + 3 DB-gated e2e (`test_alias_pipeline.py`: `load_aliases` reads the view · returning-alias persists REVIEW with
the `known_alias` entry · no-repudiation → no tag); `conftest` extended to apply **db/018–025** (was capped at 017) +
truncate `name_repudiation`, with a `seed_repudiation` helper (the C5 event floor is proven in
`identity_repudiate.rs`; this suite tests **consumption** only). Full matcher suite **199 passed / 0 skipped** with a
**PG16 + cairn_pgx 0.2.0** rig stood up from scratch in-container this session (pgrx 0.18.1, `--features pg16`,
`postgresql-server-dev-16` headers, local-TCP `trust`); pure `uv run pytest` **164 passed / 33 skipped**; ruff clean.
**Deferred (recorded):** fuzzy/edit-distance alias recognition (this cut is normalized-exact; the scorer's fuzzy name
comparison still runs on the retained-set names, so a near-miss alias is not lost, just not *tagged*); a dedicated
`alias` blocking pass (**zero recall today** — the name-token pass already generates the identical pair; pure
future-proofing, only earns its keep if a later slice stops keeping struck names in the scored retained set); any
scoring-weight treatment of known-false names (declined by design — a genuine re-weighting needs B3 weight-learning
data + a spec call, and risks suppressing true returning-persona recognition); consuming the alias pool in the C2b
auto-apply path (correct by construction — a known-alias match forces REVIEW, so it never reaches auto-apply).
**The matcher-consumes-`patient_alias_pool` wiring is now BUILT.**

**Prior session (2026-07-03) — identity C5, `repudiate` + the known-alias pool** (brainstorm→spec→plan→inline-TDD;
spec+plan under `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-07-03-identity-c5-repudiate-alias-pool*`). The **first
*suppressing*** identity event — C1–C4 were all additive/annotative; `repudiate` strikes a known-false name from the
display projection. The §5.5(a) **fabricated-persona** case: a patient presented under a deliberately false name; once
established false, the name leaves the header but **stays in the record** (fact of presentation preserved, principle 1)
and enters a matcher-visible **known-alias pool** (aliases are reused). One event type **`identity.repudiate.asserted`**
through the reused `submit_event` door, registered **`mode='suppressing'`** — so the db/005 attestation gate
**structurally forces a valid human token** (§5.7's "Human" made unbypassable, *no floor special-case*: it reuses the
exact gate that guards `salience.downgrade`). This is the deliberate design contrast with the additive C1/C3/C4 (whose
"human vouches" bit only when a responsibility-bearing contributor was named). **Digital strike-through** (principle
1+2): the assertion event and db/012's `patient_name` retained set are **left untouched**; a **value-grained**
`name_repudiation` overlay (keyed by `(subject, value)` — a false name is false *however* labelled, and value-keying
**avoids replicating db/012's `use`-fold** so there is nothing to drift; HLC-latest-wins so a future reversal composes)
records the struck value, and `patient_name_current` is `CREATE-OR-REPLACE`d to **anti-join** it (column contract
UNCHANGED ⇒ reload-idempotent). New **`patient_alias_pool`** VIEW surfaces struck names to the §5.2 matcher.
`cairn_check_repudiation_assertion` culture-neutral structural floor (valid subject uuid, non-empty value + reason) +
**HARD-required legibility twin**. **Documented design call:** striking a chart's *only* name → `patient_name_current`
has **no** row for it — honest (the name is genuinely unknown-now; displaying the known-false one is a *precise
untruth*, principle 4); "the header always shows something" is satisfied one layer up by the §5.4 callsign /
*unconfirmed* rendering (C4), not by lying. **Honest limit:** the value match is **exact-string** on an opaque value
(the only culture-neutral, deterministic, convergent choice — the suppression floor must be precise or it risks
striking the wrong, possibly true, name); fuzzy recognition of a returning alias is the **advisory matcher's** job over
`patient_alias_pool`, never the floor's. **`db/025_identity_repudiate.sql` (wired into `db.rs`) + a pure `cairn-event`
builder; NO SCHEMA/ADR/spec bump, db/010–024 left UNTOUCHED** (implements settled §5.5/§5.7; CREATE-OR-REPLACEs the
shared twin hook + `patient_name_current`). TDD: 2 pure builder unit tests + 10 DB-gated integration tests
(`crates/cairn-node/tests/identity_repudiate.rs`: struck name leaves winner + surviving name takes over + alias-pool
entry + retained-set evidence preserved · only-name → no winner (honest, never the lie) · idempotent re-assert +
HLC-latest reason · **newer re-assertion does NOT un-strike** (the HLC-blind anti-join pinned) · **un-attested AND
agent-attested repudiation refused** — the suppressing "Human" floor, both branches · four floor rejections [empty
value, empty reason, bad subject, missing twin]). Full `cargo test --workspace` (**364 passed / 0 failed**, incl.
C1/C3/C4 + demographics-names regression green) + workspace clippy clean on a **PG16 + cairn_pgx 0.2.0** rig stood up
from scratch in-container this session (pgrx 0.18.1, `--features pg16`, `postgresql-server-dev-16` headers, local-TCP
`trust` in pg_hba). **Review hardening** (3-agent adversarial pass; SQL-correctness agent found 0 hard bugs):
(a) **confidentiality split** — `patient_alias_pool` is now **reason-free** and the base `name_repudiation` table is
**not** granted to `cairn_agent`, so the free-text forensic `reason` can't leak cross-patient on the name-searchable
matcher view (ADR-0006); (b) `reason` made `NOT NULL` (the floor already guarantees it); (c) the HLC-blind anti-join +
the agent-attested-refused branch got explicit tests; (d) floor-rejection tests now also assert they reject at the
**floor**, not the attestation gate; (e) the `origin`-tiebreak collation note folded into #115. **Deferred (recorded):** a **reversal / de-repudiation** event (the overlay is HLC-versioned so it
composes with no rewrite — the append-only correction path is a separate §5.5 decision); a **chart-history VIEW**
rendering struck names (the retained set + overlay already carry the data); **matcher wiring** that *consumes*
`patient_alias_pool`; `reattribute` (§5.5 event-granular strike-through of *clinical documentation* — waits on a
clinical-note surface that does not yet exist; premature) and the full §5.4 John-Doe registration subsystem.
**Identity C5 is now BUILT — the first suppressing identity event, `repudiate` + the alias pool.**

**Prior session (2026-07-03) — identity C4, `identify` + the *unconfirmed* trust state** (brainstorm→spec→plan→
inline-TDD; spec+plan under `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-07-03-identity-c4-identify-unconfirmed*`). The third
and final state of the §5.7 chart trust-state contract C3 opened. Two **additive** event types through the reused
`submit_event` door: **`identity.pending.asserted`** (the §5.4 John-Doe front door — marks a chart identity-pending →
*unconfirmed*) and **`identity.identify.asserted`** (§5.7 "who, method": establishes identity → *confirmed*).
**Keyed by the SUBJECT itself** — a per-chart lifecycle state, unlike a dispute's own id ⇒ **no subject-consistency
guard** is possible or needed (the design contrast with C3). `cairn_check_identity_state_assertion` culture-neutral
structural floor (`basis` for pending / `method` for identify — required non-empty = "method recorded" enforced
structurally) + **HARD-required legibility twin**; `chart_identity_state` HLC-overlay table (latest-HLC wins, full
pending⇄identified lifecycle incl. re-registration re-opening unconfirmed, out-of-order convergent, no BFS/oversize
guard — cheaper than C1). **`chart_trust` reworked into a severity-max UNION** composing **under-review (open dispute,
2) over unconfirmed (pending, 1)** — the §5.9 "highest standing assertion" discipline — column contract UNCHANGED so
`CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` stays reload-idempotent and C3's `person_chart_trust` is untouched (it surfaces `unconfirmed`
for free). **Precedence** (documented safety call): under-review (attribution actively challenged — data present
possibly wrong-patient) outranks unconfirmed (who-is-this unknown — absent history). **§5.7 "Human" adjudication**:
`method` structurally required; the human-vouches requirement composes via the existing attestation gate when a
responsibility-bearing contributor is named (workflow-tier policy, not a floor special-case — considered/rejected
forcing it at the type level). **`db/024_identity_identify.sql` (wired into `db.rs`) + pure `cairn-event` builders;
NO SCHEMA/ADR/spec bump, and `db/023` left UNTOUCHED** (implements settled §5.4/§5.7; CREATE-OR-REPLACEs the shared
twin hook + `chart_trust`). TDD: 3 pure builder unit tests + 15 DB-gated integration tests
(`crates/cairn-node/tests/identity_identify.rs`: accept · HLC overlay both directions · re-pending-reopens · idempotent
re-assert · pending→unconfirmed on `chart_trust`+`person_chart_trust` · identify→confirmed · pending-before-chart
safety signal · the **C3⊔C4 compose/precedence proof** [dispute outranks pending → resolve→unconfirmed → identify→
confirmed] · five floor rejections). Full `cargo test --workspace` (0 fail incl. C1/C3 regression green) + workspace
clippy clean on a **PG16 + cairn_pgx 0.2.0** rig stood up from scratch in-container (pgrx 0.18.1, `--features pg16`,
`postgresql-server-dev-16` headers). **Deferred (recorded):** the full §5.4 John-Doe registration subsystem
(system-generated callsign, clinician-observed evidence assertions — age/marks/belongings/EMS context, matcher re-run
on new evidence); the "prior history now available" push alert on link (§5.12); registration-class partitioning of the
search-before-create funnel (§5.3/§5.8); `reattribute` (§5.5 strike-through + tiered adjudication) and `repudiate`
(alias pool + suppressing semantics); the §5.2 coherence feedback loop; person-level trust aggregation (read-surface
tier). **Identity C4 is now BUILT — the §5.7 trust-state contract (confirmed/unconfirmed/under-review) is COMPLETE.**

**Prior session (2026-07-03) — issue: identity C3, `dispute` + the chart trust-state projection** (brainstorm→
spec→plan→inline-TDD; spec+plan under `docs/superpowers/2026-07-03-identity-c3-dispute-trust-state*`). The §5.7
patient-initiated **`dispute`** front door (§5.5(b) identity theft) **and** the §5.7 projection-side contract —
the chart **trust state** (*confirmed / under-review*) — the keystone C1 explicitly deferred and that the rest of
the algebra composes into. Two **additive** dispute event types (`identity.dispute.asserted` / `.resolved`) through
the reused `submit_event` door (low-ceremony like the C1 link — a dispute *annotates* trust, never erases/moves/blocks,
so no attestation unless a responsibility-bearing contributor is named); a culture-neutral
`cairn_check_dispute_assertion` structural floor + **HARD-required legibility twin**; a `chart_dispute` standing
overlay keyed by the dispute's own id (HLC-latest-wins, converges out-of-order — the C1 `patient_link` shape, but a
single-row fact ⇒ no BFS/oversize guard); a `chart_trust` effective-state **VIEW** deliberately shaped so
`identify`/`reattribute`/the §5.2 coherence check ADD source branches later (never a rewrite); surfaced as
a composed `person_chart_trust` view. **`db/023_identity_dispute.sql` (wired into `db.rs`) + pure `cairn-event`
builders; NO SCHEMA/ADR/spec bump, and `db/018` left UNTOUCHED** (implements settled §5.7). **Review-driven design
choice** (correctness-agent finding): `person_chart_trust` is a SEPARATE view *composing on top of* C1's
`person_chart` (reusing its `person_member` join) rather than extending `person_chart` in place — the first cut
`DROP+CREATE`-d `person_chart` in both db/018 and db/023 (because `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` cannot shrink an
already-extended view across the `connect_and_load_schema` reload), but a bare `DROP` would abort node boot the moment
any dependent view sits on `person_chart` (the API/UI read surface). Composing sidesteps it: `person_chart` stays
droppable-free, and `person_chart_trust` is the view future trust-source slices extend. TDD: 3 pure builder unit tests + 14
DB-gated integration tests (`crates/cairn-node/tests/identity_dispute.rs`: accept · HLC overlay · out-of-order
convergence · multi-dispute resolve-one-stays / resolve-all-confirmed · idempotent re-assert · dispute-before-chart
safety signal · five floor rejections). Full `cargo test --workspace` (38 binaries, 0 fail) + workspace clippy green
on a stood-up **PG16 + cairn_pgx 0.2.0** rig (this session built the rig from scratch in-container: pgrx 0.18.1,
`--features pg16`). **Deferred (recorded):** the *unconfirmed* (identity-pending) state + registration classes / John
Doe (C4/C5 with `identify`); `reattribute` (§5.5 strike-through + tiered adjudication) and `repudiate` (alias pool);
the §5.2 coherence feedback loop; notification/contamination cascade on dispute; person-level trust aggregation
(read-surface tier); a future refactor to collapse the per-slice identity-floor duplication (twin-hook ladder /
uuid-check / HLC-upsert) into shared helpers **+ a deterministic final tiebreaker (content_address) on the HLC
overlay upsert** so a Byzantine same-`(wall,counter,origin)` collision can't diverge honest nodes
([#115](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/issues/115), filed from this review). **Identity C3 is now BUILT.**

**Prior session (2026-07-03) — issue: identity C2b, auto-apply of the matcher's `auto_candidate` band** (brainstorm→
spec→plan→inline-TDD; spec+plan under `docs/superpowers/`). A matcher proposal banded `auto_candidate` (score ≥ auto
AND zero vetoes at propose time) becomes a **matcher-authored, un-attested, recallable** `identity.link.asserted`
event — **no human in the loop** — through the *same* `submit_event` door. **Rust-only in `cairn-node`
(`matcher_actor.rs` + `auto_apply.rs` + `apply-auto-candidates` CLI); NO `db/` migration, NO floor change, NO
SCHEMA/ADR/spec bump** — the db/018 floor already made an identity link additive + `targets_other_author=FALSE`, so
an un-attested matcher link needs no attestation. **Realises the deferred §7.5 matcher-actor:** each distinct
`matcher_version` is its OWN `agent` actor with its OWN key (auto-enrolled on first sight, owner ceremony), pinned
under **`skill_epoch`** (= matcher_version) so db/006 `events_by_actor_epoch` recall selects a bad config's auto-links
**precisely** (contamination cascade). Contributor role **`suggested`** (ADR-0028 contributory, no `responsibility`)
⇒ authorship present, accountability absent (principle 10). **Apply-time veto re-check** (the no-human-backstop safety
add): a pair that acquired a veto since propose is kicked to human **`review`**, never auto-linked over. Status
`pending → auto_applied` (distinct from C2's human `applied`) or `→ review`; idempotent (only `pending` picked up),
respects a human `rejected`. Matcher key sealed under the op passphrase (no recovery escrow — regenerable). TDD: 6
pure + 7 DB-gated tests (`crates/cairn-node/tests/auto_apply.rs`: enroll-once/reuse · distinct-epoch actors ·
un-attested link + person projection · veto→review · human-rejected skipped · batch across epochs + idempotent ·
recall precision) + end-to-end CLI smoke (applied 1 → 1 un-attested link + 2-member person + auto_applied; re-run
applied 0). Full cairn-node suite + workspace clippy + `cargo test --workspace` green on the Mac PG18 / cairn_pgx
0.2.0 rig. **Deferred:** no background scheduler (operator CLI only); ADR-0028 role enum still not DB-enforced
([#96](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/issues/96)); richer §7.5 determinants (served-model digest). **Identity
C2b is now BUILT.**

**Merged 2026-07-02 (9 PRs; full detail in git + ROADMAP slices 6–14).** A dense build+review day whose work is now
all on `main`:
- **Quarantine/legibility trilogy** — durable quarantine + re-offer floor + loud integrity on the **clinical** pull
  plane (#108, `db/021_sync_quarantine.sql`; PR #110), the **node-event** pull plane (#111, `db/022_node_event_quarantine.sql`;
  PR #113), and wiring the **ADR-0040** legibility/skew primitives into every signature door + a daemon `cairn_pgx ≥ 0.2.0`
  startup floor (#109; PR #112). Each closes a silent skip-and-advance set-union exclusion (the A1 loss class); each
  hardened against its own PR review.
- **ADR-0040 signing-context domain separation** (#95, spec v0.40→v0.41): one envelope signature per event, domain-
  separated by a registered signing context bound twice (COSE content-type + `external_aad`); fail-closed on pre-ADR-0040
  blobs; `cairn_pgx` → 0.2.0. **The only spec/ADR bump of the day.**
- **In-DB clinical apply door** `db/020_apply_remote_event.sql` (#91): a replicated clinical event now faces the same
  in-DB floor as a locally-authored one (attestation stored + shipped on the wire; t_effective wire-pinned; clamp-and-flag
  projection guards). **Contamination-cascade recall key** fixed (#99): `events_by_actor_epoch` resolves against the full
  registry history + an `attribution` column (pinned/unattributed/pre-registration) — a superseded-epoch recall no longer
  silently under-selects.
- **Comprehensive adversarial review** (7 parallel agents over SQL floor / Rust / Python matcher / 39 ADRs;
  `docs/code_reviews/2026-07-02-comprehensive-review.md`) → a batch of in-branch floor/daemon/matcher fixes + filed issues
  **#91–#103** (design / large-refactor backlog).
- **Identity C1** (`db/018_identity_linkage.sql`): the §5.1/§5.7 linkage core — additive link/unlink types through the
  reused `submit_event` door, `patient_link` HLC-overlay edge table, `person_member` connected-component projection with
  clean unmerge (principle 2). **Identity C2** (`db/019` + `cairn-node::apply_proposal`): a human-ACCEPTED proposal becomes
  a human-ATTESTED link event (the accepting human is a responsibility-bearing contributor tripping the db/005 attestation
  gate). Both additive, no floor change. **C2b (this session) is the auto-band sibling of C2** — see top.

**Prior session (2026-07-01):** built the **§5.2 matcher B3 synthetic blocking-eval volume generator**
(brainstorm→spec→plan→subagent-SDD, 6 TDD tasks; spec+plan under `docs/superpowers/`) in `matcher/`. Pure,
stdlib-only **`eval/generator.py`** (no psycopg, 274 lines): `shares_blocking_key` mirrors the three base blocking
passes; four pure corruption operators (`corrupt_dob_format`, `corrupt_dob_typo`, `corrupt_name`,
`corrupt_identifier`); culture-plural curated name pools + `synth_seed`; `GenSpec` + `generate_dataset(spec)` builds
seed+one-corrupted-clone entity clusters (cluster size fixed at 2 — one true pair per entity) with a `_repair` step
that **guarantees** every seed↔clone pair stays recoverable by ≥1 base blocking key (appends the seed's primary name
if corruptions destroyed all keys). Deterministic (seeded PRNG). **`eval/generate.py`** is the disk/CLI edge:
`write_dataset` + `python -m cairn_matcher.eval.generate --entities N --seed S [--out path]`, byte-deterministic JSON
(`sort_keys=True`), feeding the existing `python -m cairn_matcher.eval <file>` unchanged. **Advisory tooling — no
`db/` floor, no SCHEMA bump, no spec/ADR change** (implements settled §5.2/§5.13/ADR-0014); no new dep. Tests: pure
suite **147 passed / 29 skipped** (`uv run pytest`); DB suite **173 passed**. A **drift canary**
(`test_eval_generator_sync.py`) pins `shares_blocking_key`'s mirrored assumptions to `pipeline/db.py`'s `_GROUPS_SQL`,
so narrowing a base blocking pass trips the fast suite instead of silently voiding the recoverability guarantee
(review-fix on PR #88). New DB-gated volume test: on a generated
200-entity set at `max_block_size=10_000`, `pair_completeness==1.0`, 0 dropped true matches, `reduction_ratio≈0.919`
(6,467/79,800 pairs) — the recoverability invariant confirmed end-to-end through the real blocking SQL. This is a
regression/volume instrument, not a statistical accuracy claim: the generated set is recoverable **by construction**,
not by resemblance to real-world data. **Deferred (recorded, not lost):** variable cluster size (>2 records/entity);
a deliberately unrecoverable fraction (models the hub-sweep floor); hard negatives / scorer-precision curves; an
A/B pass-toggle in `generate_candidate_pairs` for one-command before/after (today it's git-revert) — this last one
is what would unblock a *quantitative* compound-key before/after using this generator; still deferred.
**The §5.2 matcher B3 synthetic volume generator is now BUILT.**

**Prior session (2026-07-01):** built the **§5.2 matcher B3 compound blocking key — name-token + birth-year**
(brainstorm→spec→plan→subagent-SDD; spec+plan under `docs/superpowers/`). One **additive** `UNION ALL` branch in
`pipeline/db.py`'s `_GROUPS_SQL` (a `birth_year` CTE + a `name+year` pass): it partitions an over-broad single-name-token
block by birth-year so the sub-blocks survive the oversized-block cap, recovering true-match pairs the cap would drop
wholesale. Additive ⇒ **recall non-decreasing** (pairs deduped by canonical uuid pair across passes); also rescues
**precision-mismatched** DOBs (`"1990"` vs `"1990-05-12"` — same first 4-digit run groups them, exact-DOB never does).
Birth-year is an **honest, culture-neutral degrade** (principle 4): the **first 4-consecutive-digit run**
(`substring(value FROM '[0-9]{4}')`, guarded by `value ~ '[0-9]{4}'`) — no date parsing, no calendar; an ISO value and a
day-first import (`"12/05/1990"`) of the same person both yield `1990` and group, while a DOB with no 4-digit run stays
covered by the single-token pass. (Originally a leading-only `left(value,4)`/`^[0-9]{4}` guard; widened to the 4-digit-run
form 2026-07-01 so cross-format imports group — advisory, so a mis-extracted year only ever feeds the scorer extra pairs it
rejects, never a false link.) **Advisory — no `db/` floor, no SCHEMA bump, no spec/ADR change**
(implements settled §5.2/§5.13/ADR-0014); no new dep; `db.py` 166 lines. Tests: 5 new DB-gated integration tests (rescue,
honest-degrade, precision-mismatch, cross-format, cross-pass dedup); full matcher suite **151 with DB / 123 + 28 skipped** without.
Harness sanity check on a clean DB: `pair_completeness=1.000`, `reduction_ratio=0.911`, 0 dropped true matches on `gold_v1`
(additivity confirmed). Per-task opus/sonnet reviews clean (spec ✅). **Known limitation** (user-flagged): year extraction
still degrades on 2-digit years and non-Gregorian calendars — revisit on richer/real data (safe degrade, not a false group).
Discovered + filed **[issue #84](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/issues/84)** (pre-existing: integration tests
commit-leak rows via `seed_patient`; `evaluate_blocking` `KeyError`-crashes on a dirty DB — out of this slice's scope).
**The §5.2 compound-blocking-keys item is now BUILT.**

**Prior session (2026-06-30):** built the **§5.2 matcher eval harness (piece B3 keystone)** — a labelled-dataset
measurement substrate to unblock the measurement-driven B3 items (compound blocking keys, weight-learning), via
**brainstorm→spec→plan→subagent-SDD** (8 TDD tasks + final review; spec+plan under `docs/superpowers/`). New
pure-by-default **`matcher/src/cairn_matcher/eval/`** sub-package mirroring the `pipeline/` pure-core + optional-DB split:
**`dataset.py`** (entity-cluster JSON format + loader; `record_to_candidate` *reuses the real `candidate_from_rows`
adapter* — no drift; `truth_pairs`/`all_pairs` ground truth), **`metrics.py`** (confusion + precision/recall/F1 at
strict+lenient operating points + auto-false-link-rate + missed-match-rate + score separation; zero-denominator → 0.0,
never NaN), **`scorer_eval.py`** (`evaluate_scorer` runs the *real* `field_comparisons→score→band` path; `weights`/
`thresholds`/`config` are params — the weight-learning lever; banding with no veto = documented pure-eval simplification),
**`report.py`** (plain-text report incl. the honest "regression/tuning instrument, not a statistical accuracy claim"
caveat), **`__main__.py`** (`python -m cairn_matcher.eval` — scorer always; blocking when `CAIRN_TEST_PG`, psycopg
**lazy-imported** so the pure path never touches it), **`blocking_eval.py`** (DB-gated, `pipeline` extra: seeds `patient_*`
label→uuid5, calls the *real* `generate_candidate_pairs`, `conn.rollback()` xmin-guard, computes pair-completeness /
reduction-ratio / dropped-true-matches / Σ`C(size,2)` dropped-pair estimate), + a hand-authored **culture-plural gold
fixture** (`eval/fixtures/gold_v1.json`: mononym / patronymic+diacritic / multi-token). **Advisory only — no `db/` floor
file, no SCHEMA bump, no spec/ADR change** (implements settled §5.2/§5.13/ADR-0014). **No new dep** (pure core stdlib-only;
blocking under existing `pipeline`/psycopg extra). Tests: **146 with DB** / **123 + 23 skipped** without (`uv run pytest`);
purity probe confirms the pure surface (incl. `__main__`) imports no psycopg. Final **opus whole-branch review:
READY-TO-MERGE, 0 Critical / 0 Important** (real-path reuse/no-drift, purity, advisory-only, metric math all verified;
two cosmetic Minors applied in-branch). **Post-review fixes (in-branch, PR #83):** `blocking_eval.seed_dataset` no longer
`conn.commit()`s — the seed now lives in the read txn that `evaluate_blocking`'s `rollback()` discards, so the DB-gated
eval is **idempotent + leaves no synthetic patients** (a committed seed would re-hit `patient_demographic`'s
`PK(patient_id, field)` on a second run, since `uuid5` labels are deterministic); the dataset loader now validates
name/identifier inner keys → a located `DatasetError` instead of an opaque downstream `KeyError`. **Deferred (recorded, not lost):** the **synthetic corruption generator** (volume +
recall curves, same format); the **compound-blocking-keys** + **weight-learning** slices themselves (this harness *measures*
them); a **veto-aware / end-to-end scorer mode**. **The §5.2 matcher eval harness (B3 keystone) is now BUILT.**

**Prior session (2026-06-30):** built the **§5.2 advisory matcher — piece B2b** (blocking / candidate-pair generation +
batch sweep): read-only `db.generate_candidate_pairs(conn, *, max_block_size=100)` — a 3-pass blocking disjunction
(shared identifier excl. `unknown` · exact-DOB · shared name token), group CTEs deduped to canonical `(low,high)` by uuid
VALUE order, oversized-block guard → `skipped_blocks` (never a silent cap) — + `pipeline/sweep.py` (`sweep()` two-phase
batch driver: generate→`rollback` xmin-guard, then loop `runner.propose()` per pair with skip-and-report errors). Advisory;
no `db/` floor, no SCHEMA bump. 113 with DB / 93+20 skipped without. Opus review READY-TO-MERGE 0C/0I. Merged **[PR #81](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/pull/81)**. **B2b BUILT.**

**Prior session (2026-06-29):** built the **§5.2 advisory matcher pipeline — piece B2** (veto-gated **pairwise**
pipeline + advisory proposal worklist) in a new IO-bearing sub-package **`cairn_matcher/pipeline/`** beside B1's pure
core: pure `adapter.py` (`patient_*` rows → `CandidateRecord`; ISO DOB, `sorted()` token-bag names, `match_key`
identifiers, safe-degrade) + pure `banding.py` (`MatchScore`+veto → `auto_candidate` iff `≥T_auto` **and no veto**,
else `review`, else `None`; any veto caps at `review`, never auto-link/auto-reject) + `db.py`/`runner.py` (the only
psycopg modules; `propose` = load→score→veto→band→upsert→commit, commit owned by runner). New **`db/017_match_proposal.sql`**
(SCHEMA 15→16): an **advisory** worklist table (human `status` preserved on re-run) — *not a safety gate*. **psycopg**
optional (`pipeline` extra). 92 with DB / 87+5 skipped without. Opus review MERGE-READY 0C/0I. Non-blocking Minors →
**[issue #79](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/issues/79)**. **B2 BUILT.**

**Prior sessions (2026-06-28/29) — §5.2 matcher pieces A + B1 (condensed; full detail in ROADMAP slices 6–7 + git):**
**piece A** = the **§4.4/§5.2 in-DB hard-veto floor** (`db/016_match_veto.sql`, SCHEMA 14→15; `cairn_match_veto` returns
the closed hard-veto set — same-system identifier mismatch · verified-DOB clash · verified-sex-at-birth clash; two
verdicts `hard_veto`/`degrade_hold`; precision-gated, parses no dates; `system:unknown` never vetoes; forces a human
decision, never auto-link/auto-reject; 12 integration tests; deceased-status veto deferred, stub in db/016). **piece B1**
= the **§5.2/§5.13 advisory scoring core** (new `matcher/` uv project, `cairn-matcher`, AGPL-3.0, **zero runtime deps,
pure functions only** — the fit-for-purpose §9 tier): the `Comparator`/ordinal `AgreementLevel` contract (`PHONETIC`/`NICKNAME`
reserved but never emitted by core — anti-cultural-capture), in-house **Jaro–Winkler** + 4 culture-neutral comparators
(`compare_exact`/`compare_edit_distance`/`compare_dob` [parses no date strings]/`compare_name_set`) + positive-only
`compare_identifier_sets` (never DISAGREE) + the field→comparator registry + the **Fellegi–Sunter** combiner producing an
explainable `MatchScore`; 55 pure tests; final review caught + fixed one Critical (`score(a,b)≠score(b,a)` from greedy
name-pairing → now `max(greedy(a,b),greedy(b,a))`, symmetric). No new ADR, no spec bump (both implement settled
§5.2/§5.13/§4.4; refine ADR-0014/0033).

**Prior session (2026-06-28):** **globalised the §3.13/§4.5 author-materialised legibility twin to every event type**
(ADR-0039; spec v0.39 → v0.40), via brainstorm→spec→plan→subagent-SDD (5 tasks, spec+plan under `docs/superpowers/`).
The in-DB floor (`db/015_globalise_twin.sql`, SCHEMA 13→14) now PREFERS the authored twin for every type; non-demographic
types **degrade honestly** to a flagged, payload-rendering derived skeleton when absent (older/non-conformant peer) —
set-union convergence preserved; the two demographic types KEEP ADR-0034's HARD authored-twin requirement. Authored-vs-derived
is **NOT stored** — it is derivable from the immutable signed body via `cairn_twin_is_authored(bytea)` + the
`event_twin_provenance` view; **no new column, `submit_event` NOT re-declared** (only the `cairn_event_twin` hook changed).
Improved `cairn_twin_skeleton` now renders the payload — **closes the `db/005:29` TODO**. `cairn-event` gained pure
`resolve_twin` + `materialise_generic_twin` (the single rule both cairn-sync and the SQL floor follow); `cairn-sync` now
carries the authored twin on apply and materialises it on authoring. Tests: cairn-event 3 unit (36/36 suite green); cairn-node
4 integration (`twin_globalise` — authored verbatim+flag; twin-less degrade+flag+payload; twin-less demographic hard-reject
triple-gated; + a whitespace-twin demographic hard-reject); demographics + attestation regress green; clippy clean. A
**floor bug** surfaced by the whitespace hardening test was fixed in the same branch: PG `trim()` strips only ASCII space
(not `\n`/`\t`), so the blank-test used `length(regexp_replace(x,'\s+','','g'))>0` in **both** the write gate (`v_authored`)
and read predicate (`cairn_twin_is_authored`), realigning them with Rust `str::trim()`. Residual Unicode-whitespace
asymmetry (PG `\s` ⊂ Rust `char::is_whitespace`; degrades safe) tracked as [issue #75](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/issues/75).
**The "globalise the authored twin" deferral is now CLOSED.**

**Prior sessions (2026-06-27/28) — demographics slices 1–5, condensed (full detail in ROADMAP slices 1–5 + git):**
**slice 1** = §4.4 patient-identifier assertion end-to-end (`db/010`, `EventBody.plaintext_twin`, `cairn_event_twin`

**Demographics slices 1–5 + gaps A/B/C all done; §4.2/§4.3/§4.4/§4.5/§4.6 complete.**

**Prior sessions (2026-06-25/26)** — ADR-0026 node durability slices B/C/D closed (backup-as-cold-peer, restore +

**Status of this file:** Disposable working scaffolding, **not** a source of truth. Regenerate at the end
of each session. If it ever disagrees with the canonical docs, **the canonical docs win.** The *why* lives
in the immutable ADR log; the *what* lives in the spec; this file only carries what lives *between* them —
current build state, open threads, and time-sensitive items.

## Read these first (the durable state)

- **`docs/spec/index.md`** — canonical architecture spec (mission prose + document map + spec version).
  One file per aspect; cross-refs like *§5.7* stay valid inside the aspect file.
- **`docs/spec/decisions/`** — the **ADR log** (the *why*). Numbered, dated, **immutable** (a reversal is a
  new superseding ADR). **Read the relevant ADR before reopening a settled question.** Index below.
- **`docs/ROADMAP.md`** — the foundation build order (wire core → in-DB floor → sync → identity →
  security → federation → blobs → native API), *below* the policy/GUI line. Disposable scaffolding like
  this file; the spec/ADRs win on any disagreement.
- **`docs/spikes/`** — build-prep records (*what we tried, on what, what we learned*). Not spec, not ADR.
- **`docs/principles/`** — mission/governance; **`GOVERNANCE.md`** + `STEWARDSHIP-OF-THE-NAME.md`.
- Root **`README.md`** — mission + founding principles (same prose as `index.md`).
- Code workspace: `/crates` (`cairn-event`, `cairn-sync`, `cairn-node`), `/extensions` (`cairn_pgx`), `/db`.
  `poc/` is frozen historical spikes.

## Where the build actually is (the live, in-progress state)

### First federating node — built 2026-06-21, [PR #28](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/pull/28)
First *implementation* of [ADR-0017](spec/decisions/0017-federation-admission-sovereignty-peering-and-trust-anchors.md)
(federation admission), scoped to **direct-pairwise trust, no clinical surface** — only the federation
machinery flows, exercising the one safety-critical seam (*verified credential → admitted peer*) E2E. **No
spec/ADR change.** Built: `cairn-node` (Ed25519 keystore, `init`/`identity`/pairing/`peers`/`unpeer`, built-in
mTLS pinned to the trust set, set-union `node_event` sync, honest `status`); `db/007` append-only `node_event`
+ `submit_node_event` door + `apply_remote_node_event` deny-all admission gate (reuses `cairn_verify` pgrx — no
new crypto). Genesis-stable `node_id` = content-address of the genesis enrollment event. Two-node E2E green on
local PG16 + `cairn_pgx`.

**Honest gaps / follow-ons declared in the node (candidate "harden the node" work):**
- ~~`status` **crashes if run before `init`**~~ **closed 2026-06-23** — `load_local_opt` (`query_opt`) +
  an `initialized` flag; `status` degrades honestly with a "run `cairn-node init`" hint
  (`tests/status.rs::status_before_init_degrades_gracefully`).
- **In-DB floor caveat** — ~~runtime should connect as a login role granted `cairn_node` (NOLOGIN)~~
  **closed 2026-06-23**: `db::provision_runtime_role` (charset-guarded against DDL injection) + a
  `provision-runtime-role` CLI subcommand create that role, and `tests/floor_enforced.rs` now **proves the
  ENFORCED path** — over a `cairn_node`-granted login role a raw `INSERT` into `node_event` is denied
  (SQLSTATE 42501), `status` reports `db_floor ENFORCED`, yet `submit_node_event` still works.
- ~~**Key-at-rest plaintext-0600**; **DR/recovery escrow a named stub** (`dr_escrow: STUBBED`)~~ **closed
  2026-06-24** (ADR-0026 **slice A**, [PR #44](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/pull/44)): the signing key is now **sealed at rest** — a random DEK seals the
  seed (XChaCha20-Poly1305), DEK **dual-wrapped** under Argon2id KEKs from an operational passphrase
  **and** a one-time **recovery code** (paper escrow, shown once at `init`). New pure `seal.rs`
  (seal/unseal/CBOR + base32 recovery code); `keystore` gained `generate_sealed`/`generate_plaintext`/
  `seal_existing` + auto-detect `load` + `key_at_rest_state`; CLI seals by default (`--insecure-plaintext`
  escape hatch) and added `seal-key` migration; daemon unseals via `CAIRN_KEY_PASSPHRASE`. `status` now
  reports `key_at_rest SEALED` + `dr_escrow recovery code set` + `recovery_escrow`. **Honest ceiling
  (documented, not engineered away): lose both the passphrase AND the recovery code → node loss.**
- ~~Genesis **HLC 0/0 placeholder**; **full-pull, no incremental watermark**~~ **closed 2026-06-23**
  ([issue #38](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/issues/38), **merged [PR #42](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/pull/42)**):
  incremental pull keyed on a monotonic local-insertion `node_event.seq` (a node always inserts newly-learned
  events with a fresh high `seq`, so the watermark is **structurally** skip-proof — decoupling it from the HLC,
  which dissolved the stated coupling), per-peer `sync_cursor` written only through an advance-only
  `checkpoint_sync_cursor` `SECURITY DEFINER` door (the runtime role keeps **zero raw DML**), with an explicit
  periodic + trust-change-triggered **full-sweep** as the correctness floor for the residual commit-order /
  rejected-then-trusted / address-remap hazards. The `0/0` HLC is now a real local clock (`hlc_state` +
  `node_hlc_tick()` + merge-forward on apply, mirroring `cairn-sync`). Acceptance test
  `sync_watermark::out_of_order_skip_is_reconciled_by_full_sweep` proves a jammed-cursor skip is reconciled by
  the sweep; the seq prefix is transport-only (signed core byte-identical, principle 12). Full node suite green
  on PG16 + `cairn_pgx`, clippy clean.
- ~~**backup-as-cold-peer** + backup-health (slice B)~~ **export half closed this session**: `backup`/`verify-backup`
  CLI + `last_backup` status line; signed-event medium, self-verifying via the existing signature invariant (tamper
  → non-zero exit); fail-safe node-local health sidecar; **verify-before-write** (the image self-verifies *before* the
  atomic rename, so a bad set never overwrites the previous good medium) plus a read-after-write tripwire gate the
  health update so it never over-claims. New `backup.rs` (pure medium format + verify + health) + shared `fsio`
  atomic-write.
- ~~**Restore (apply) + new-identity `supersede`** (slice C, [#50](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/issues/50))~~
  **closed**: `cairn-node restore` + self-trusting `restore_node_event` door (empty-genesis fenced), `supersede`(dead→new),
  fresh-key mint, `status` `supersedes` line. `db/009` + a `supersede` branch in `submit_node_event` (db/007). Residual
  footgun ~~[#53](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/issues/53) (a federated medium's `--superseded-node` could name a
  peer)~~ **closed this session** via the container-level self-marker (`medium.rs`, `CAIRNB2`; signed+medium-bound or
  unsigned) — see top.
- ~~**Sealed local-state export** (slice D, ADR-0026 point 3)~~ **closed this session**: `localstate.rs` (LSK dual-wrap,
  `CAIRNL1`/`CAIRNX1` containers, additive `LocalState` with empty slots, DB seams); `.lsk` at provisioning;
  `establish-local-state-key`; `backup` writes / `restore` consumes the export; `status` `local_state` line. **All ADR-0026
  slices (A–D) now done.** Remaining escrow *rungs* (Shamir M-of-N, QR, TPM/keyring) are optional upward options, not blockers.
- ~~atomic key-file write ([issue #45](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/issues/45)); passphrase
  `zeroize`-on-drop ([issue #46](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/issues/46))~~ **closed 2026-06-25**:
  `write_key_file` is now atomic (temp sibling → fsync → `rename` → **parent-dir fsync**, 0600 forced
  explicitly), so an interrupted `init`/`seal-key` can never leave a half-written key that boots `Corrupt`,
  the rename itself survives a power loss (not just the bytes), and a stale wide-perm `<key>.tmp` can no longer
  leak its mode onto the key; the operational passphrase and recovery code are held as `Zeroizing<String>`
  from `resolve_passphrase`/prompt through to the Argon2 call, wiped on drop (`zeroize` was already a transitive
  dep — no new crate). TDD: red-first tests for the new `tmp_sibling` helper, no-temp-litter, stale-temp clobber,
  0600 perms, stale-wide-perm-temp non-leak, and the `Zeroizing` return type. (PR #49 review: + dir fsync,
  explicit 0600, non-unix fsync.)
- Test rig: DB-gated tests need local PG + `cairn_pgx` (`cargo pgrx install` against PG16); they self-serialize
  cluster-wide via a Postgres advisory lock (`db::test_serial_guard`), so plain `cargo test --workspace` is reliable.

### Spike 0002 (advisory-actor write contract) — ran 2026-06-21, C1–C5 PASS, [PR #27](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/pull/27) → ADR-0029 + ADR-0030
An external advisory agent authored an additive, un-attested, recallable advisory through the validated in-DB
door, **and the floor rejected all five hostile-agent attacks** with legible reasons. PR #27 review (the user)
caught two real floor holes the spike's own review missed — forged authorship (unbound `signer_key_id`) and a
`PUBLIC`-executable `SECURITY DEFINER` door — both fixed before merge (recorded in ADR-0030).

**Honest gap (closed 2026-06-22):** the attestation **success** path (a *valid*, correctly-bound
token accepted) was never exercised E2E — now closed by `cairn-sync attest-stdin` (the token minter),
`crates/cairn-node/tests/attestation.rs` (accept for responsibility-bearing + suppressing events; reject for
wrong-address, tampered, and non-human-attester), and `spike_0002.py` selftest (external-actor accept +
wrong-address/tamper). No `submit_event` logic changed — the accept branch already existed; this is the
coverage that was missing. ~~**Smaller deferred items remain open** (commented in code):
`events_by_actor_epoch` resolves against `actor_current` not historical `actor_event` rows;
`actor_current` wall-clock ordering needs a monotonic tiebreaker before production; no FK on
`recall_overlay.target_event_id`; plaintext twin is skeletal.~~ **All four closed:** the three recall-surface
items 2026-07-02 (issue #99 session, see top); the skeletal twin by ADR-0039 (2026-06-28).

### Dual-identifier discipline — ADR-0031, merged 2026-06-22 ([PR #34](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/pull/34); `local_ref` honesty fix merged 2026-06-24 [PR #43](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/pull/43))
New **[ADR-0031](spec/decisions/0031-canonical-identifiers-and-node-local-surrogate-keys.md)** (canonical
identifiers + node-local surrogate keys): canonical plane (UUIDv7 + multihash) is unchanged and is the *only*
identifier on the wire/in signed bodies; the **projection plane** may intern canonical IDs to dense node-local
`bigint` surrogates as physical join keys. Leakage of a surrogate into a signed body = silent cross-node
corruption, so it is made *hard* (distinct domain type, mapping confined to floor functions, API egress always
the global ID). Landed with `db/008_surrogate_projection.sql` + the Bet B5 leakage guard. Final magnitude is
**measured on Bet B** (Pi), exactly as ADR-0001's compute bet — a "no measurable win" result narrows scope, not
fails the discipline.

**Honest gap (fixed 2026-06-24, [issue #35](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/issues/35)):** the prose
called the `local_ref` domain a "real two-way type barrier," but a PG domain over `bigint` is *not* — a
surrogate flows into any plain `bigint` with no cast/error (empirically confirmed). Corrected the wording in
`db/008`, spike 0001 §6.2, PI-RUNBOOK §6.1, and the walking-skeleton README to name the *actual* load-bearing
guarantee (signed plane typed `uuid` + `bigint ≠ uuid` + the G2 assertion) and to frame the domain honestly as
an intent-signal + one-directional guard. Rewrote **G4** in `db/tests/008_surrogate_test.sql`: it now asserts
the functions exist first (no more vacuous pass via `undefined_function`, now dropped), proves the genuine
guard (G4a `uuid`↛`local_ref`; G4b `bigint`↛`uuid` signed plane), and **characterizes the honest limit**
(G4c: `bigint` flows into `local_ref` silently). The spec body (§3.18) and immutable ADR-0031 were already
accurate (one-directional framing), so neither was touched. All G1–G6 green on PG16. **Merged 2026-06-24 ([PR #43](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/pull/43)).**

### Spike 0003 (Postgres on Android) — ran 2026-06-25, G0–G3 PASS, merged ([PR #47](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/pull/47) + [PR #48](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/pull/48))
Validated the **fractal-topology** invariant at the phone tier (RedMagic 11 Pro). Native PG 18.2 execs, `initdb`s,
serves SQL over TCP, and a cross-built pgrx extension loads + runs (incl. SPI) — no Termux userland, no root, no VM.
The one real blocker was `libandroid-shmem` (compile-baked Termux prefix + dead `/dev/ashmem`), fixed by a
self-contained, pinned-upstream patch. Runnable kit at [`poc/pg-android-kit/`](../poc/pg-android-kit/) + a
Medium-style write-up. **Remaining non-load-bearing gaps:** from-source PG build and APK/`jniLibs` packaging
(not blocking — the bet is proven). No spec/ADR change.

## Open threads — pick one (today's-work menu)

**Desk-doable now (no external dependency):**
- **Demographics build — next slices** (the live build front; reuse the spine in `db/010`/`db/011`/`db/013`/`db/014` +
  `cairn-event::demographics`). Slices 1–5 are done (§4.4 identifiers, §4.2 DOB + sex-at-birth, §4.2 names,
  §4.2 administrative-sex + gender-identity, §4.3 address). **Karyotype** is resolved as a distinct field ([ADR-0037](spec/decisions/0037-demographic-administrative-sex-and-per-field-winner-policy.md)) — no code yet.
  **§5.2 matcher:** piece A (in-DB hard-veto floor, `db/016`), B1 (advisory **Python** scoring core), B2 (veto-gated
  **pairwise** pipeline + `db/017` proposal worklist), B2b (blocking / candidate-pair generation + `sweep()` driver,
  `cairn_matcher/pipeline/{db,sweep}`), **the B3 eval harness** (`cairn_matcher/eval/` — scorer metrics +
  DB-gated blocking-recall measurement + culture-plural `gold_v1.json` + `python -m cairn_matcher.eval` CLI), the
  **B3 compound blocking key** (`name+year` additive pass in `pipeline/db.py`), and the **B3 synthetic volume
  generator** (`eval/generator.py` pure + `eval/generate.py` CLI — seed+corrupted-clone entity clusters, recoverable
  by construction) are now BUILT. It unblocks measuring blocking recall/reduction at volume (confirmed:
  `pair_completeness==1.0` on a generated 200-entity set) — **but not yet** a quantitative before/after across a
  compound-key change, which needs the still-deferred A/B pass-toggle below. **Next (B3 measurement-driven):**
  **weight-learning** (sweep `evaluate_scorer`'s `weights`/`thresholds` against the gold set) + **further compound
  keys** (`dob+first-initial`, `name+sex`) + locale comparator packs / hub-tier aggressive duplicate-sweep +
  proposal retraction / **richer §7.5 matcher-actor determinants** (served-model digest; C2b registered the matcher as
  a per-epoch `agent` actor keyed on `matcher_version`). **Identity: pieces C1** (§5.1/§5.7 linkage core — `db/018`),
  **C2** (`match_proposal`→apply seam — `db/019`, `apply_proposal.rs`; human-accepted → human-attested link), **and
  C2b** (auto-apply of the `auto_candidate` band — `matcher_actor.rs` + `auto_apply.rs`; matcher-authored, un-attested,
  recallable link, apply-time veto re-check), **C3** (`dispute` + the chart trust-state projection — `db/023`;
  the §5.7 projection-side contract, driven by the patient-initiated dispute front door), **and C4** (`identify` +
  the *unconfirmed* trust state — `db/024`; the §5.4 John-Doe identity-pending front door + the `identify` resolver,
  composing the third trust state into a severity-max `chart_trust`) **are now BUILT — the §5.7
  confirmed/unconfirmed/under-review contract is COMPLETE**, **and C5** (`repudiate` + the known-alias pool — `db/025`;
  the first *suppressing* identity event, a value-grained `name_repudiation` overlay striking a known-false name from
  `patient_name_current` and surfacing it via `patient_alias_pool`, `mode='suppressing'` forcing the human-attestation
  floor) **is now BUILT**. **Next identity slice: C5+** — `reattribute` (§5.5 event-granular strike-through of *clinical
  documentation* + tiered adjudication — **waits on a clinical-note surface** that does not yet exist; premature to
  build against demographics) + the rest of the §5.4 John-Doe registration subsystem. **§5.4 slice A (callsign minting +
  matcher placeholder exclusion) is now BUILT this session** — `cairn-event::john_doe::callsign` + `cairn-node::john_doe::
  register_john_doe` (composes a `use_key='callsign'` name assertion + C4's `identity.pending.asserted`) + a
  `register-john-doe` CLI + the advisory matcher exclusion (`use_key <> ALL(%s)`) in `pipeline/db.py`; NO new event
  type / migration / floor / SCHEMA bump. **Remaining §5.4:** clinician-observed evidence assertions (age/observed-sex
  reuse existing demographic fields; photo/marks/belongings/EMS-context need a new field home — separate slice), the
  "prior history now available" push-alert on link (§5.12, no notification tier yet), the search-before-create
  registration-class funnel (§5.3/§5.8, UI/API tier), a readable sequential callsign suffix (partition-safe per-day
  count), and `identify`→optional-link wired into one resolution flow. Reattribute composes one more *under-review*
  source into the `chart_trust` VIEW when it lands. Deferred (repudiate): a **reversal / de-repudiation** event (overlay HLC-versioned, composes without rewrite);
  a **chart-history VIEW** rendering struck names; ~~**matcher wiring** consuming `patient_alias_pool`~~ **(DONE this
  session — known-alias evidence; flag-never-suppress; fuzzy recognition + a dedicated `alias` blocking pass deferred)**. Deferred: an **A/B pass-toggle**
  in `generate_candidate_pairs` (one command instead of git-revert for compound-key before/after — the piece that
  would make the volume generator's numbers a quantitative comparison); variable cluster size / an unrecoverable
  fraction / hard negatives in the volume generator; a **veto-aware / end-to-end scorer mode**; deceased-status veto
  (stub in db/016); a `compare_address` comparator; a **CLI** sweep entry; the matcher test-leak + harness `KeyError`
  ([issue #84](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/issues/84)); B2 follow-up Minors (Thresholds `review<auto` guard,
  `band` CHECK, `updated_at` trigger, conftest env read-at-import) → [issue #79](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/issues/79).
  Rust DB-gated tests + the matcher integration tests need `CAIRN_TEST_PG="host=127.0.0.1 port=5532 user=hherb
  dbname=cairn_test"` (PG18+cairn_pgx); matcher integration: `cd matcher && CAIRN_TEST_PG=… uv run --extra pipeline
  pytest`. The pure matcher suite is dependency-free: `cd matcher && uv run pytest` (uv, never venv/pip).
- **Clinical case-mining** — historically the highest-signal generative mode; the event-overlay + key-custody +
  actor primitives have absorbed every case so far without new architecture. Bring a real ED/hospital failure mode.
- **Dedupe transitive RustCrypto dep versions** in `Cargo.lock` ([issue #11](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/issues/11)) — supply-chain
  hygiene. **Re-verified 2026-06-25: still blocked on upstream** — the `postgres` stack pulls `digest 0.11`/`sha2 0.11`/`chacha20 0.10`
  while `chacha20poly1305 0.10.1` still depends on `chacha20 0.9` and `ed25519-dalek` on `digest 0.10`. Not fixable from our `Cargo.toml`; revisit when the ecosystem converges.
- **Harden the first federating node** — status-before-init crash, runtime-login-role/floor-ENFORCED proof,
  incremental sync watermark + genesis HLC ([#38](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/issues/38), PR #42),
  and **all four ADR-0026 durability slices** — A (at-rest seal + recovery escrow, PR #44), B (cold-peer export+health,
  PR #51), C (restore + `supersede`, PR #52), **D (sealed local-state export, this session)** — are all **closed**
  (see node gaps above). **ADR-0026 is fully implemented at the node tier.** No remaining required node-hardening thread;
  ~~[#54](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/issues/54) (uniform key zeroization)~~ and ~~[#53](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/issues/53)
  (federated-restore self-identification)~~ both **closed 2026-06-26**; only optional escrow rungs (Shamir/QR/TPM) remain.
  The `localstate` DB read/apply **seams** are where the future clinical tier plugs DEKs/drafts/config.
- **Landing-page polish** — non-developer page for the generated site (frontend-design; `web/` already advanced
  across PRs #15–#17; draft plans under `docs/superpowers/`).

**Blocked on hardware / external access:**
- **Bet B — Pi compute-cost run** ([Spike 0001 §9](spikes/0001-walking-skeleton-wan-sync-and-pi-cost.md#9-bet-b--results-raspberry-pi-5--8-gb-2026-06-25--pass-with-two-honest-caveats)):
  **RAN 2026-06-25 on a Pi 5 / 8 GB → PASS** (all §6 gates green, large headroom; B4 **confirms** ADR-0015's
  BLAKE3 blob-digest default — BLAKE3 ~4× SHA-256 on Cortex-A76). Artifacts in
  [`poc/walking-skeleton/results/`](../poc/walking-skeleton/results/). **Two caveats** (precision, not verdict):
  storage ran on a **USB-2-limited dock** (power-offload workaround after a Pi 5 brown-out saga — see the §9.2
  *deployment-BOM finding*: PSU + storage-attachment path are part of the validated BOM), and on **PG 16**
  because **`cairn_pgx` is pgrx-0.12.9 / `pg16`-pinned and won't build on PG 18** (§9.3). Bonus: `cairn_pgx`
  builds+loads on Pi arm64 (in-DB Rust surface confirmed on ARM). **Open follow-ups:** ~~(a) port `cairn_pgx` to a
  PG-18-capable pgrx~~ **done 2026-06-25 ([PR #56](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/pull/56): pgrx 0.12.9 → 0.18.1,
  default feature `pg16`→`pg18`)**; (b) clean re-run on **PG 18 + USB-3 SSD + official 27 W PSU** for authoritative
  precision numbers; (c) fold the B4 number into the ADR-0015 follow-up to drop "provisional" from the blob-digest line.
- **easyGP session** — port the [ADR-0020](spec/decisions/0020-active-write-thin-encounters-and-the-delete-vs-erase-distinction.md)
  deferred items with live easyGP schema access: the `rx!`/`tx!` type-through parser + state machine; the
  formulation/drug data source + renal/hepatic/pregnancy/paediatric **forced-manual** rule table; the
  prefetch/materialization warming daemon (validates ADR-0001 from production). Pre-read
  `scratch/ui-sketches/easygp-prefetch-notes.md`.
- **Byte-tier throughput lever** — connection reuse / persistent streaming instead of one TCP connection per
  slice (the production object-store tier). The §8.2 availability + windowing/resume work already shipped.

## Parked (don't re-litigate without new reason)

- **Stewarding legal entity & jurisdiction** (German Stiftung/Verein, US 501(c)(3), or an umbrella) — deferred
  until momentum/funding geography is clearer.
- **Formal trademark / wordmark registration** — principle recorded (stewardship doc); legal instrument deferred.

## Working context (most also in CLAUDE.md)

- The user is a senior **EM physician**, GNUmed founder (early FOSS Postgres EHR), codes mostly in Python, brings
  real ED/hospital failure modes from multiple health systems. **The mission (anti-capture / anti-vendor-lock-in)
  is the tie-breaker.** Criticism is strongly encouraged — surface flaws/risks immediately.
- **Twelve founding principles** run through everything ([index.md](spec/index.md)); the first four are the lens
  for every design choice: (1) append-only + causal ordering; (2) identity is a claim — never merge/erase, always
  link/overlay; (3) paper-parity (no confirmation dialogs); (4) acknowledged uncertainty. See CLAUDE.md for the
  full set (5–12) and the §9 defect-blast-radius language-selection rule.
- **Governance done** ([GOVERNANCE.md](principles/GOVERNANCE.md) + root `CONTRIBUTING.md`): AGPL-3.0 inbound=outbound,
  DCO, **no CLA**; mission as tie-breaker. Names/domains/packages secured (`cairn-ehr` org; `cairn-ehr.org`+`.com`;
  PyPI/crates.io/npm `@cairn-ehr` placeholders).
