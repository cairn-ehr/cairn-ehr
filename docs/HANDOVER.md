# HANDOVER — Cairn

**Session date:** 2026-06-24 · **Spec/ADRs:** v0.31 (+ADR-0031) · **Phase:** architecture complete; proving viability
through proof-of-concept spikes (walking skeleton, advisory-actor contract, a first federating node) — no
clinical implementation yet. (Status lines across spec/README/GOVERNANCE were realigned to this framing this session.)

**Status of this file:** Disposable working scaffolding, **not** a source of truth. Regenerate at the end
of each session. If it ever disagrees with the canonical docs, **the canonical docs win.** The *why* lives
in the immutable ADR log; the *what* lives in the spec; this file only carries what lives *between* them —
current build state, open threads, and time-sensitive items.

---

## Read these first (the durable state)

- **`docs/spec/index.md`** — canonical architecture spec (mission prose + document map + spec version).
  One file per aspect; cross-refs like *§5.7* stay valid inside the aspect file.
- **`docs/spec/decisions/`** — the **ADR log** (the *why*). Numbered, dated, **immutable** (a reversal is a
  new superseding ADR). **Read the relevant ADR before reopening a settled question.** Index below.
- **`docs/ROADMAP.md`** — the foundation build order (wire core → in-DB floor → sync → identity →
  security → federation → blobs → native API), *below* the policy/GUI line. Disposable scaffolding like
  this file; the spec/ADRs win on any disagreement.
- **`docs/spikes/`** — build-prep records (*what we tried, on what, what we learned*). Not spec, not ADR.
- **`docs/principles/`** — mission/governance; **`GOVERNANCE.md`** + `STEWARDSHIP-OF-THE-NAME.md`.
- Root **`README.md`** — mission + founding principles (same prose as `index.md`).
- Code workspace: `/crates` (`cairn-event`, `cairn-sync`, `cairn-node`), `/extensions` (`cairn_pgx`), `/db`.
  `poc/` is frozen historical spikes.

---

## Stale-doc cleanup — done this session

- **Status lines realigned** (spec/index.md, README.md ×2, GOVERNANCE.md ×2): were "Architecture / specification
  phase — no implementation yet" (and GOVERNANCE flatly claimed *"implementation has not started"*); now framed as
  *spec complete; proving viability through proof-of-concept spikes; no clinical implementation yet.*
- **`docs/spikes/README.md` Spike 0002 row fixed** — was *"Proposed — not yet run,"* now *"Ran ✓ — C1–C5 PASS
  (PR #27) → ADR-0029/0030."*
- **CLAUDE.md updated** — opening reframed from "no code, build system, or tests yet" to the
  proof-of-concept-spikes framing, and a new **"Coding house rules"** section enshrined (AGPL-3.0 + compatible
  deps · TDD · inline docs for a junior dev · pure reusable functions over clever complexity · fix review findings
  or file a GitHub issue).

## Where the build actually is (the live, in-progress state)

### First federating node — built 2026-06-21, [PR #28](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/pull/28)
First *implementation* of [ADR-0017](spec/decisions/0017-federation-admission-sovereignty-peering-and-trust-anchors.md)
(federation admission), scoped to **direct-pairwise trust, no clinical surface** — only the federation
machinery flows, exercising the one safety-critical seam (*verified credential → admitted peer*) E2E. **No
spec/ADR change.** Built: `cairn-node` (Ed25519 keystore, `init`/`identity`/pairing/`peers`/`unpeer`, built-in
mTLS pinned to the trust set, set-union `node_event` sync, honest `status`); `db/007` append-only `node_event`
+ `submit_node_event` door + `apply_remote_node_event` deny-all admission gate (reuses `cairn_verify` pgrx — no
new crypto). Genesis-stable `node_id` = content-address of the genesis enrollment event. Two-node E2E green on
local PG16 + `cairn_pgx`.

**Honest gaps / follow-ons declared in the node (candidate "harden the node" work):**
- ~~`status` **crashes if run before `init`**~~ **closed 2026-06-23** — `load_local_opt` (`query_opt`) +
  an `initialized` flag; `status` degrades honestly with a "run `cairn-node init`" hint
  (`tests/status.rs::status_before_init_degrades_gracefully`).
- **In-DB floor caveat** — ~~runtime should connect as a login role granted `cairn_node` (NOLOGIN)~~
  **closed 2026-06-23**: `db::provision_runtime_role` (charset-guarded against DDL injection) + a
  `provision-runtime-role` CLI subcommand create that role, and `tests/floor_enforced.rs` now **proves the
  ENFORCED path** — over a `cairn_node`-granted login role a raw `INSERT` into `node_event` is denied
  (SQLSTATE 42501), `status` reports `db_floor ENFORCED`, yet `submit_node_event` still works.
- ~~**Key-at-rest plaintext-0600**; **DR/recovery escrow a named stub** (`dr_escrow: STUBBED`)~~ **closed
  2026-06-24** (ADR-0026 **slice A**): the signing key is now **sealed at rest** — a random DEK seals the
  seed (XChaCha20-Poly1305), DEK **dual-wrapped** under Argon2id KEKs from an operational passphrase
  **and** a one-time **recovery code** (paper escrow, shown once at `init`). New pure `seal.rs`
  (seal/unseal/CBOR + base32 recovery code); `keystore` gained `generate_sealed`/`generate_plaintext`/
  `seal_existing` + auto-detect `load` + `key_at_rest_state`; CLI seals by default (`--insecure-plaintext`
  escape hatch) and added `seal-key` migration; daemon unseals via `CAIRN_KEY_PASSPHRASE`. `status` now
  reports `key_at_rest SEALED` + `dr_escrow recovery code set` + `recovery_escrow`. **Honest ceiling
  (documented, not engineered away): lose both the passphrase AND the recovery code → node loss.**
- ~~Genesis **HLC 0/0 placeholder**; **full-pull, no incremental watermark**~~ **closed 2026-06-23**
  ([issue #38](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/issues/38), **merged [PR #42](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/pull/42)**):
  incremental pull keyed on a monotonic local-insertion `node_event.seq` (a node always inserts newly-learned
  events with a fresh high `seq`, so the watermark is **structurally** skip-proof — decoupling it from the HLC,
  which dissolved the stated coupling), per-peer `sync_cursor` written only through an advance-only
  `checkpoint_sync_cursor` `SECURITY DEFINER` door (the runtime role keeps **zero raw DML**), with an explicit
  periodic + trust-change-triggered **full-sweep** as the correctness floor for the residual commit-order /
  rejected-then-trusted / address-remap hazards. The `0/0` HLC is now a real local clock (`hlc_state` +
  `node_hlc_tick()` + merge-forward on apply, mirroring `cairn-sync`). Acceptance test
  `sync_watermark::out_of_order_skip_is_reconciled_by_full_sweep` proves a jammed-cursor skip is reconciled by
  the sweep; the seq prefix is transport-only (signed core byte-identical, principle 12). Full node suite green
  on PG16 + `cairn_pgx`, clippy clean.
- Still open (remaining ADR-0026 slices): the sealed **local-state export** (config + drafts, not just the
  key); **backup-as-cold-peer** + backup-health (slice B); **key rotation / `supersede`** + new-identity
  restore (slice C); Shamir M-of-N, QR, TPM/keyring. Also deferred: atomic key-file write (torn-write →
  `Corrupt` bundle), passphrase `zeroize`-on-drop.
- Test rig: DB-gated tests need local PG + `cairn_pgx` (`cargo pgrx install` against PG16); they self-serialize
  cluster-wide via a Postgres advisory lock (`db::test_serial_guard`), so plain `cargo test --workspace` is reliable.

### Spike 0002 (advisory-actor write contract) — ran 2026-06-21, C1–C5 PASS, [PR #27](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/pull/27) → ADR-0029 + ADR-0030
An external advisory agent authored an additive, un-attested, recallable advisory through the validated in-DB
door, **and the floor rejected all five hostile-agent attacks** with legible reasons. PR #27 review (the user)
caught two real floor holes the spike's own review missed — forged authorship (unbound `signer_key_id`) and a
`PUBLIC`-executable `SECURITY DEFINER` door — both fixed before merge (recorded in ADR-0030).

**Honest gap (closed 2026-06-22):** the attestation **success** path (a *valid*, correctly-bound
token accepted) was never exercised E2E — now closed by `cairn-sync attest-stdin` (the token minter),
`crates/cairn-node/tests/attestation.rs` (accept for responsibility-bearing + suppressing events; reject for
wrong-address, tampered, and non-human-attester), and `spike_0002.py` selftest (external-actor accept +
wrong-address/tamper). No `submit_event` logic changed — the accept branch already existed; this is the
coverage that was missing. **Smaller deferred items remain open** (commented in code):
`events_by_actor_epoch` resolves against `actor_current` not historical `actor_event` rows;
`actor_current` wall-clock ordering needs a monotonic tiebreaker before production; no FK on
`recall_overlay.target_event_id`; plaintext twin is skeletal.

### Dual-identifier discipline — ADR-0031, merged 2026-06-22 ([PR #34](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/pull/34); `local_ref` honesty fix merged 2026-06-24 [PR #43](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/pull/43))
New **[ADR-0031](spec/decisions/0031-canonical-identifiers-and-node-local-surrogate-keys.md)** (canonical
identifiers + node-local surrogate keys): canonical plane (UUIDv7 + multihash) is unchanged and is the *only*
identifier on the wire/in signed bodies; the **projection plane** may intern canonical IDs to dense node-local
`bigint` surrogates as physical join keys. Leakage of a surrogate into a signed body = silent cross-node
corruption, so it is made *hard* (distinct domain type, mapping confined to floor functions, API egress always
the global ID). Landed with `db/008_surrogate_projection.sql` + the Bet B5 leakage guard. Final magnitude is
**measured on Bet B** (Pi), exactly as ADR-0001's compute bet — a "no measurable win" result narrows scope, not
fails the discipline.

**Honest gap (fixed 2026-06-24, [issue #35](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/issues/35)):** the prose
called the `local_ref` domain a "real two-way type barrier," but a PG domain over `bigint` is *not* — a
surrogate flows into any plain `bigint` with no cast/error (empirically confirmed). Corrected the wording in
`db/008`, spike 0001 §6.2, PI-RUNBOOK §6.1, and the walking-skeleton README to name the *actual* load-bearing
guarantee (signed plane typed `uuid` + `bigint ≠ uuid` + the G2 assertion) and to frame the domain honestly as
an intent-signal + one-directional guard. Rewrote **G4** in `db/tests/008_surrogate_test.sql`: it now asserts
the functions exist first (no more vacuous pass via `undefined_function`, now dropped), proves the genuine
guard (G4a `uuid`↛`local_ref`; G4b `bigint`↛`uuid` signed plane), and **characterizes the honest limit**
(G4c: `bigint` flows into `local_ref` silently). The spec body (§3.18) and immutable ADR-0031 were already
accurate (one-directional framing), so neither was touched. All G1–G6 green on PG16. **Merged 2026-06-24 ([PR #43](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/pull/43)).**

## Open threads — pick one (today's-work menu)

**Desk-doable now (no external dependency):**
- **Clinical case-mining** — historically the highest-signal generative mode; the event-overlay + key-custody +
  actor primitives have absorbed every case so far without new architecture. Bring a real ED/hospital failure mode.
- **Dedupe transitive RustCrypto dep versions** in `Cargo.lock` ([issue #11](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/issues/11)) — supply-chain hygiene cleanup.
- **Harden the first federating node** — status-before-init crash, runtime-login-role/floor-ENFORCED proof,
  incremental sync watermark + genesis HLC ([issue #38](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/issues/38), PR #42),
  **and at-rest keystore seal + recovery escrow** (ADR-0026 slice A) are all **closed** (see node gaps
  above). Remaining ADR-0026 slices: sealed local-state export; backup-as-cold-peer (B); key rotation /
  `supersede` + new-identity restore (C).
- **Landing-page polish** — non-developer page for the generated site (frontend-design; `web/` already advanced
  across PRs #15–#17; draft plans under `docs/superpowers/`).

**Blocked on hardware / external access:**
- **Bet B — Pi compute-cost run** ([Spike 0001 §6](spikes/0001-walking-skeleton-wan-sync-and-pi-cost.md)): the
  [ADR-0001](spec/decisions/0001-fat-postgres-thin-daemon.md) projection/keystore go/no-go. Runbook + self-describing
  harness ready ([`PI-RUNBOOK.md`](../poc/walking-skeleton/PI-RUNBOOK.md)); **awaiting the Pi 5 / 16 GB / 1 TB SSD.**
  The one number that could revisit ADR-0015's *provisional* BLAKE3 blob-digest default is the ARM SHA-256-vs-BLAKE3
  result. Floor experiment = a Pi 4 / 8 GB (changes only `--label`).
- **Spike 0003 — Postgres on Android** ([0003](spikes/0003-postgres-on-android-bionic-node.md), Proposed): validates
  the fractal-topology invariant at the phone tier (RedMagic 11 Pro). Bionic Postgres is de-risked; the **pgrx
  cross-compile is the one genuinely unproven step**. Awaiting an on-device run.
- **easyGP session** — port the [ADR-0020](spec/decisions/0020-active-write-thin-encounters-and-the-delete-vs-erase-distinction.md)
  deferred items with live easyGP schema access: the `rx!`/`tx!` type-through parser + state machine; the
  formulation/drug data source + renal/hepatic/pregnancy/paediatric **forced-manual** rule table; the
  prefetch/materialization warming daemon (validates ADR-0001 from production). Pre-read
  `scratch/ui-sketches/easygp-prefetch-notes.md`.
- **Byte-tier throughput lever** — connection reuse / persistent streaming instead of one TCP connection per
  slice (the production object-store tier). The §8.2 availability + windowing/resume work already shipped.

---

## Parked (don't re-litigate without new reason)

- **Stewarding legal entity & jurisdiction** (German Stiftung/Verein, US 501(c)(3), or an umbrella) — deferred
  until momentum/funding geography is clearer.
- **Formal trademark / wordmark registration** — principle recorded (stewardship doc); legal instrument deferred.

---

## Working context (most also in CLAUDE.md)

- The user is a senior **EM physician**, GNUmed founder (early FOSS Postgres EHR), codes mostly in Python, brings
  real ED/hospital failure modes from multiple health systems. **The mission (anti-capture / anti-vendor-lock-in)
  is the tie-breaker.** Criticism is strongly encouraged — surface flaws/risks immediately.
- **Twelve founding principles** run through everything ([index.md](spec/index.md)); the first four are the lens
  for every design choice: (1) append-only + causal ordering; (2) identity is a claim — never merge/erase, always
  link/overlay; (3) paper-parity (no confirmation dialogs); (4) acknowledged uncertainty. See CLAUDE.md for the
  full set (5–12) and the §9 defect-blast-radius language-selection rule.
- **Governance done** ([GOVERNANCE.md](principles/GOVERNANCE.md) + root `CONTRIBUTING.md`): AGPL-3.0 inbound=outbound,
  DCO, **no CLA**; mission as tie-breaker. Names/domains/packages secured (`cairn-ehr` org; `cairn-ehr.org`+`.com`;
  PyPI/crates.io/npm `@cairn-ehr` placeholders).
