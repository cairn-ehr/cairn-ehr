# Paper-parity measurement runbook (§1.2 / [#288](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/issues/288))

**What this measures, and what it does not.** The plan's time budget — chart open → list
rendered → unsigned lines signed **≤ 15 s** for a 5-drug list, one cease **≤ 5 s** — was
*seeded, not measured*. This runbook produces the measured figure. It is one operator on one
machine: an honest data point, not a study.

**Explicitly excluded: finding the patient.** The window launches with `--patient <uuid>`
and there is no patient picker in this slice (the §5.3/§5.8 search-before-create funnel is
unbuilt). Every recorded run must repeat that exclusion, because the paper counterpart —
picking the right chart off a trolley — is a real act with a real wrong-chart hazard, and a
figure that quietly omits it would flatter the architecture.

**The accessibility pass is a separate act.** It is a live screen-reader run (VoiceOver on
macOS, Orca on Linux, NVDA on Windows) against the same window, recorded in the same file.
Automating DOM assertions in CI is [#332](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/issues/332)
and needs a JS-toolchain decision this slice deliberately did not take.

## 0. Prerequisites

A node database with `cairn_pgx` installed, and this node's key. For a throwaway rig — every
command below was run end-to-end on 2026-08-03, so the flags are the real ones:

```bash
export CONN="host=127.0.0.1 port=5532 user=$USER dbname=cairn_measure"
export NODE_KEY=/tmp/measure-node.key

psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5532 -d postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE cairn_measure"
psql "$CONN" -c "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS cairn_pgx"

cairn-node --conn "$CONN" --key "$NODE_KEY" \
    init --name measure-rig --address 127.0.0.1:0 --insecure-plaintext   # test rig only
```

> `--key` is a **global** flag: it comes before the subcommand, not after it. Every command
> below follows that shape.

## 1. Enrol the clinician who will sign

The window signs as an **enrolled human actor** (ADR-0053); an unenrolled key is refused at
unlock. Two clinicians need two *distinguishing determinants* — enrolling both as a bare
`{"role":"clinician"}` collides into one `actor_id` and is refused
([ADR-0044](../../../docs/spec/decisions/0044-enroll-fail-closed-on-actor-id-collision.md)).

```bash
cairn-node --conn "$CONN" --key /tmp/dr-a.key enroll-human --handle dr-a --insecure-plaintext
cairn-node --conn "$CONN" --key /tmp/dr-b.key enroll-human --handle dr-b --insecure-plaintext
```

> The window unlocks a **sealed** key with a passphrase. For a measured run that is the
> realistic path — seal `dr-a.key` (`cairn-node seal-key`) and use its passphrase at the
> unlock prompt. An unsealed key needs no passphrase and makes the unlock step vanish, which
> would understate the gesture.

## 2. Seed a five-drug chart, three of which are unsigned

The benchmark's row: *review a 5-drug list, sign 3 unsigned/stale lines.* So two lines must
already carry **someone else's** current signature — that is what proves the gesture leaves
another clinician's vouch alone rather than reassigning it.

Since [#345](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/issues/345) a chart must be **registered**
before anything can be recorded about it — the §5.3/§5.8 precedence rule, enforced in the
database. A hand-minted `uuidgen` id is refused by `medication-assert`, which is the point: you
cannot write on a chart nobody made, exactly as on paper. `patient-register` runs the
search-before-create funnel and prints the new id on its last line.

```bash
NODE="cairn-node --conn $CONN --key $NODE_KEY"
PATIENT=$($NODE patient-register --name "Bench Patient" --birth-date 1980-01-01 \
    --confirm-new | sed -n 's/^registered patient //p')
[ -n "$PATIENT" ] || { echo "registration failed — read the output above" >&2; exit 1; }

# Three lines nobody has signed.
$NODE medication-assert "$PATIENT" \
    --term atorvastatin --dose-amount 40 --dose-unit mg --formulation tablet
$NODE medication-assert "$PATIENT" \
    --term metformin --dose-amount 1 --dose-unit g --formulation tablet
$NODE medication-assert "$PATIENT" \
    --term sertraline --dose-amount 50 --dose-unit mg --formulation tablet

# Two lines Dr B has already signed — author-time attestation in one act.
$NODE medication-assert "$PATIENT" \
    --term amlodipine --dose-amount 5 --dose-unit mg --formulation tablet \
    --attest-as /tmp/dr-b.key
$NODE medication-assert "$PATIENT" \
    --term perindopril --dose-amount 4 --dose-unit mg --formulation tablet \
    --attest-as /tmp/dr-b.key

echo "PATIENT=$PATIENT"
```

Confirm the chart before measuring anything — if it does not read the way you expect, the
measurement measures the wrong thing:

```bash
$NODE medication-list "$PATIENT"
```

Expect exactly this shape — five lines, two carrying Dr B's short key id:

```
amlodipine 5 mg     [current] — signed by 2d234868
atorvastatin 40 mg  [current] — unsigned
metformin 1 g       [current] — unsigned
perindopril 4 mg    [current] — signed by 2d234868
sertraline 50 mg    [current] — unsigned
```

**If it reports groups missing from the chart, stop** and clear that first: you would be
timing a gesture over a chart the node already says is incomplete.

## 3. Launch the window

```bash
cd cairn-gui
cargo run --release -p cairn-gui-tauri -- \
    --patient "$PATIENT" --conn "$CONN" \
    --key "$NODE_KEY" --attester-key /tmp/dr-a.key
```

`--release` matters: a debug build measures the compiler's tempo, not the design's.

## 4. The measured gestures

Start the stopwatch **when the window appears**, not when the command is typed — process
start-up is not a clinical act and is not what the budget is about.

1. **Review and sign.** Unlock the key, read the five lines, press *Sign off 3 unsigned
   medication(s)*. Stop the clock when the outcome line reports the result. Record the wall
   time, and note whether the count on the button matched the number of lines you judged to
   need a signature.
2. **Cease one drug.** Type a reason into a current row and press *Stop*. Stop the clock when
   the outcome line reports it.

Repeat each gesture at least five times on fresh charts (re-run §2), because the aggregates
below are running estimates and a single sample tells you nothing about the tail.

## 5. Read the aggregates back

The node records what each *write* cost, with no user, no patient and no timestamp — see the
header of [`db/044_ui_gesture_timing.sql`](../../../db/044_ui_gesture_timing.sql) for why the
absent columns are the design.

```bash
psql "$CONN" -c "SELECT * FROM ui_gesture_timing ORDER BY gesture_kind, size_bucket"
```

These are the **write** costs. Your stopwatch figure is the **whole gesture** including human
review, and it is the one the §1.2 budget is about; the table exists so the write half keeps
being measured in use, long after this runbook is forgotten.

## 6. The accessibility pass

Run the window again with `--mock` (no database, and the fixture chart deliberately carries a
cross-patient line and an invisible group so the warnings are exercised):

```bash
cargo run -p cairn-gui-tauri -- --mock --patient 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001
```

With the screen reader on, and **keyboard only**, confirm each of these. Record a verdict per
line, not one overall pass:

- [ ] Every drug line announces drug, dose, status **and whose signature it carries** in one
      utterance — not by hunting cell to cell.
- [ ] The chart-level warnings are announced **before** the table content.
- [ ] Each *Stop* button announces the drug it stops, not a bare "Stop".
- [ ] Each reason field announces which drug it belongs to.
- [ ] The sign-off button announces the real number of threads it will sign.
- [ ] Every control is reachable by Tab, and the focus ring is visible at every stop.
- [ ] A line that will be signed is identifiable **without colour** (its signature cell says
      "will be signed").
- [ ] A ceased line is identifiable without colour (its status cell says "ceased").

## 7. Record it

Copy [`TEMPLATE.md`](TEMPLATE.md) to `YYYY-MM-DD-<host>.md` and fill it in. **Record the
number you measured, whatever it is.** If the observed p95 falls outside the provisional
15 s / 5 s budget, that is the finding — file an issue and write it down. Adjusting the
budget to match the result would make the benchmark unfalsifiable, which is the one thing
§1.2 cannot afford.
